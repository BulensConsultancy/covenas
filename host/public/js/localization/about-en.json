He has an innate ability to calm people around him and make you feel safe and supported. I almost quit during my practice sessions in the pool because the thought of removing my mask and reapplying it terrified me! </p><p>Guillermo was patient, reassuring and encouraging and the single reason I persisted. Guillermo manages to balance professionalism and fun perfectly. His knowledge of diving and safety as well as his commitment to maintaining high standards with every course makes him the epitome of excellence. I cannot recommend him enough!</p>"

Gracias!</p>"

			"review":"<p>I took a trip to beautiful Santa Marta, one of the main attractions in the place is the beautiful beaches and most of all the amazing underwater life. I was lucky enough that Guillermo was on the way to my hostel with his fiancé, what an amazing guy! First, he speaks English as stupid as it sounds you won't find lots of people speaking English in this town so high advantage.</p><p>He was so calm and took it very slowly explaining me exactly what to look for and kept staying close to me while we were diving.When underwater is not your territory knowing that someone got your back is a key factor, Guillermo was my guard and I can't be thankful enough! Highly recommended!</p>"
